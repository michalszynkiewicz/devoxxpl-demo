= Quarkus Advertisement Microservice

A quarkus microservice that provides a JAX-RS endpoint
to get random ads based on the search keywords provided by a user.

Every time a search request is received by the link:../search[search] service,
the ads service is reactively notified.
This way, it can keep a history of the search keywords given
by each user to provide contextual ads.
That feature is implemented using Microprofile Reactive Streams.

== Running the application

You can start the application in development mode,
that will enable hot deployment, by executing the following maven command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
