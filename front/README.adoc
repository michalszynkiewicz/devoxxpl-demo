= Quarkus Search Front-end

A quarkus front-end application that enables a user to search for pages
using keywords. Contextual random ads are shown based on the user's keyword history.

The app communicates with the link:../search[search] and link:../ads[ads] microservices
to get the data to display.

== Running the application

You can start the application in development mode,
that will enable hot deployment, by executing the following maven command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
