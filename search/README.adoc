= Quarkus Search Engine Microservice

A quarkus microservice that provides a JAX-RS endpoint
to search pages based on keywords given by a user.

It stores the metadata for each page in a PostgreSQL database,
including an associated keyword and its URI.

The database access is performed using https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache[Panache],
a Quarkus extension that reduces boilerplate by providing
a DAO/Repository implementation.

Every time a user performs a search, the provided keywords
are reactively sent to the link:../ads[ads] service,
so that it can provide contextual ads for users.
That feature is implemented using Microprofile Reactive Streams.

== Running the application

You can start the application in development mode,
that will enable hot deployment, by executing the following maven command:
